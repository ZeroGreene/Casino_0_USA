machines that can do it:

Fully-automated / minimal-prep pizza machines & vending-type solutions

The Let's Pizza vending machine — this is a real machine that prepares dough from scratch (flour + water + sauce + toppings) and cooks it in an infrared oven — producing a ready-to-eat pizza in ~3 minutes. 

The PizzaForno vending system (and similar pizza-vending machines) — although these use pre-made dough or pre-assembled pizzas rather than making everything from scratch, they do bake (or reheat) and dispense fresh pizzas quickly via a robotic vending system. 

Commercial/industrial machines sold under smaller manufacturers (e.g. some described by sources as “pizza vending machines” or “pizza bots”) — these are more for businesses or automated pizza kiosks rather than typical home kitchens. 


⚠️ Reality check: fully automated “dough + topping + bake + serve” machines are rare — outside dedicated vending-machine business use. For most home users, machines end up focusing on baking rather than fully automating dough/toppings from raw ingredients.
